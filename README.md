Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Modding Web App (PC)

This app allows you to modify unit skills and equipment (add or replace items) and generates a ready-to-use XML file, which can replace the original game file.

Manual modding in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is often tedious and error-prone. A single mistake can break the game, and editing multiple units at once is especially frustrating. 
This app solves those problems by providing an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly interface with all the functionality needed to customize units quickly and reliably.

No prior knowledge of Bannerlord modding is required - even absolute beginners can use it with ease.
